# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Using HTML, javascript, CSS, and APIs this page loads a weather dashboard with a search bar for specified cities. 
When pressing the search button the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history for later use from local storage. The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.The UV index changes color so that it indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. There is also a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
